    *   **Dependencies**: More specific error types from analysis functions.
    *   **Risks**: Overly technical error messages.
    *   **Recommendation**: Enhance error messages to be more specific. Instead of just "Analysis failed," provide details like "Unsupported image format," "Corrupted image data," "Memory limit exceeded during processing," or "EXIF data extraction failed."
        *   **File**: `src/utils/imageAnalysis.ts`, `src/components/ImageGrid.tsx` (for displaying errors), `src/components/FileUpload.tsx`

*   **Robustness Against Malformed Data**
    *   **Priority**: Medium
    *   **Effort**: Medium
    *   **Impact**: Prevents crashes or unexpected behavior when processing unusual or malformed image files.
    *   **Dependencies**: Thorough testing with edge-case files.

    *   **Recommendation**: Implement a structured logging mechanism (e.g., using a simple utility function) that logs detailed information (e.g., function entry/exit, key variable values, specific error details) to the browser console, with different levels (info, warn, error) that can be controlled in development vs. production.
        *   **File**: `src/utils/logger.ts` (new file), integrate into all `src/utils` files and `src/App.tsx`

## 4. Scalability & Maintenance

### Current Code Maintainability
The project demonstrates good maintainability with a clear React component structure, TypeScript for type safety, and a well-organized `src` directory. The use of React hooks (`useState`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`) and Tailwind CSS contributes to clean and efficient code. ESLint is configured for code quality.

### Suggested Architectural Improvements

*   **Web Workers for Image Processing (Reiteration)**
    *   **Priority**: High
    *   **Effort**: High
    *   **Impact**: This is the single most important scalability improvement. It allows the application to handle larger image batches and more complex analyses without freezing the UI.
    *   **Dependencies**: Significant refactoring of `src/utils/imageAnalysis.ts` and related functions to be worker-compatible.
    *   **Risks**: Debugging across main thread and workers can be challenging.
    *   **Recommendation**: As mentioned in Features, this is critical. The current sequential processing in `App.tsx`'s `handleFilesSelected` will block the UI. Moving `analyzeImage` to a Web Worker is essential.
        *   **File**: `src/App.tsx`, `src/utils/imageAnalysis.ts`, new worker file.

*   **Refine State Management for Processing Flow**
    *   **Priority**: Medium
    *   **Effort**: Medium
    *   **Impact**: Improves clarity and testability of the processing logic, especially as features like pause/resume are added.
    *   **Dependencies**: None.
    *   **Risks**: Over-engineering for current scope.
    *   **Recommendation**: While current React hooks are sufficient for local state, for managing the complex processing flow (e.g., tracking individual image progress within a batch, handling pause/resume states, and communicating between main thread and workers), consider centralizing the processing state logic within a custom React Context or a dedicated processing manager hook. This would make the `ProgressBar` and `FileUpload` components more decoupled from the core processing logic.
        *   **File**: `src/App.tsx`, new context/hook (e.g., `src/hooks/useProcessingManager.ts`)

*   **Explore WebAssembly for Performance-Critical Algorithms**
    *   **Priority**: Low
    *   **Effort**: High
    *   **Impact**: Provides near-native performance for computationally intensive parts of the image analysis.
    *   **Dependencies**: Learning WebAssembly, potentially Rust/C++ development.
    *   **Risks**: Increased build complexity, larger bundle size, debugging challenges.
    *   **Recommendation**: For algorithms like Laplacian variance (blur detection) or complex feature extraction (Harris, FAST, LoG), investigate implementing them in WebAssembly. This is a long-term optimization strategy mentioned in `docs/TECHNOLOGY_STACK.md`.
        *   **File**: `src/utils/imageProcessing.ts`, `src/utils/descriptorAnalysis.ts`, new WebAssembly modules.

*   **Automated Testing (Unit & Integration)**
    *   **Priority**: Medium
    *   **Effort**: High
    *   **Impact**: Ensures code quality, prevents regressions, and facilitates future development and refactoring.
    *   **Dependencies**: Testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library).
    *   **Risks**: Initial setup time, maintaining test suite.
    *   **Recommendation**: Implement unit tests for utility functions (e.g., `imageProcessing.ts`, `compositeScoring.ts`, `qualityAssessment.ts`) and integration tests for key component interactions (e.g., `FileUpload`, `ImageGrid`). This will significantly improve the confidence in code changes and overall stability.
        *   **File**: New `__tests__` directories for components and utils.
