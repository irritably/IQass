  // Monitor performance benchmarks and optimization
}
```

### Custom Configuration

```typescript
// Customize lazy loading behavior
const lazyLoadingOptions = {
  rootMargin: '100px',     // Preload distance
  threshold: 0.1,          // Visibility threshold
  unloadOnExit: false      // Memory vs performance trade-off
};

// Configure performance benchmarking
const benchmarkOptions = {
  enableLogging: true,     // Development logging
